The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Python之禅 来自Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
优雅好于丑陋
Explicit is better than implicit.
显示高于隐式
Simple is better than complex.
简洁优于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.
复杂好过混乱
Flat is better than nested.
扁平好过嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.
分散好过紧凑
Readability counts.
可读性非常重要
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
特殊情况不足以违反规则
Although practicality beats purity.
尽管实用胜过存粹
Errors should never pass silently.
错误不应该沉默保留
Unless explicitly silenced.
除非明确保留
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
面对模棱两可，拒绝猜测的诱惑
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
应该有一种——最好只有一种——显而易见的方法来做到这一点
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
尽管除非您是荷兰人，否则这种方式一开始可能并不明显。
现在总比没有好。
Although never is often better than *right* now.
尽管从来没有比*现在*更好。
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
如果实现很难解释，那就不是一个好主意。
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
如果实现很容易解释，那可能是个好主意。
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
命名空间是一个非常棒的想法——让我们做更多这样的事情吧！
